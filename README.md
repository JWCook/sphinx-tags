# sphinx-tags
A tiny Sphinx extension that implements blog-style tags for documentation.

## Notes
* This is a fork with some options removed or modified for my own use case. You probably want to use the original project instead: https://github.com/melissawm/sphinx-tags
* This project is loosely based on [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18146107/how-to-add-blog-style-tags-in-restructuredtext-with-sphinx).
